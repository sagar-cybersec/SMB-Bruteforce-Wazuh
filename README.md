# SMB Brute Force Detection using Wazuh

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the detection of an SMB brute-force attack in a controlled lab environment using Wazuh SIEM.

A Kali Linux machine was used to simulate SMB brute-force attempts against a Windows 11 victim system.  
The Windows system was configured with a Wazuh agent, which forwarded security logs to the Wazuh Manager for analysis and alerting.

The goal of this project is to showcase hands-on SOC skills such as attack simulation, log analysis, alert validation, and threat detection.
